- Volume reactive visual effects for ESP32 and ESP8266 devices.
- Frequency reactive visual effects for ESP32 devices.
- UDP sound synchronization with transmit for ESP32 and receive for ESP8266 and ESP32 devices.
- 2D visual effects for ESP32 devices.
- Squelch and gain settings for ESP8266 and ESP32 devices for the volume reactive visual effects.
- 2D settings for ESP32 devices.
- Frequency reactive sliders for ESP32 devices.

We currently have 3 active forks for our Sound Reactive WLED. They are:

- [ESP32 standard version (ESP8266 is no longer supported)](https://github.com/atuline/WLED)
- [ESP32 development version (ESP8266 is no longer supported)](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/tree/dev)
- [ESP8266 version (No longer supported. WILL NOT receive regular updates)](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/tree/ESP8266)

In addition, we have a [Sound Reactive WLED Wiki](https://github.com/atuline/WLED/wiki).
